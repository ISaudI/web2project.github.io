# Web2Project's Documentation Site

This is the repository for all the documentation for Web2Project which currently resides at http://docs.web2project.net

The underlying theme for this site is https://github.com/Wiredcraft/carte

If you want to run this locally yourself, check out Github's getting started documentation here: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/ and then run:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Todo list

* The entire site needs a good scrubbing/update
