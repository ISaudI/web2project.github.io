### Class Structure

As of v2.0, the class structure within the /classes folder has been refactored to support the Namespaces Standard from the [PHP FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/). Web2project will not formally make use of Namespaces in any of the v2.x releases but this will make it easier to support in the v3.x releases.
