== Reporting Problems ==

Any and all issues discovered should be added to our [http://bugs.web2project.net/view_all_bug_page.php our Issue Tracking System].  Feature requests should be marked as such and not described as issues.

For more information, support, or to discussion upcoming features, please visit [http://forums.web2project.net/ our Support Forums].

== New Features ==

*  A permissions caching layer:
**  Previously all permissions were calculated at runtime, now they are re-calculated for a given user whenever any of that users' permissions or Roles are changed reducing runtime queries by 90% in some cases;
**  Also allows questions along the lines of "who has access to this project?" to be answered without recalculating all user's permissions;
**  Provides a screen to review any users' permissions for anything in the system;
*  Overall permissions improvement:
**  Now the system assumes no permissions on an object until a Role or specific Permission describes otherwise;
*  A user interface overhaul - rounded corners, we're web2.0 ready!
*  Improved installer:
**  A dotProject to web2project converter detects and handles all versions of dotProject from v2.0;
**  An upgrade manager detects the current web2project version and applies database changes as required, similar to Migrations;
**  Added numerous configuration/requirement validations and specific error messages were applicable;
*  Added a number of new fields to the Contact object to accommodate new IM systems;
*  Added the beginning of a "hook" system similar to Drupal:
**  Reworked the queuescanner.php to automatically detect and call any hook_cron methods on system objects;
**  [http://bugs.web2project.net/view.php?id=74 74] Implemented an iCal feed (in ./calendar.php) to automatically detect and call any hook_calendar methods on system objects;
*  Added the ProjectDesigner to core;
*  Improved the getUser call to only retrieve active users in the system;
*  Simplified the various add/edit screens to only retrieve data relevant to the current context;
*  Added the ability for potential users to request an account for the system, made this ability toggle-able by the admin;
*  Added the ability for contacts to update their information without logging in, etc;
*  Added a check that will warn and stop a user from trying to upload/attach a file if the underlying filesystem permissions are incorrect;

== Bugs Closed ==

*  Fixed the fonts issue on the gantt charts to use the distributable FreeSans font as opposed to Arial;

== Misc Changes/Improvements ==

*  Security:
**  Improved the datatype validation, SQL Injection protection, and anti-XSS code;
**  Removed various data access calls from numerous Views, refactored all of these to the Models;
**  Simplified and centralized all the permissions checks to reduce duplication
*  Refactoring:
**  Removed tickets.inc.php from the search objects;
**  Removed the {class}_func.php files and the ./functions folder by merging the functions into the relevant classes;
**  Tweaked the module reordering code to keep the order id's contiguous in order to prevent id's from "drifting" out of order;
**  Cleaned up the double quotes to use single quotes where applicable;
**  Cleaned up the Installer's sql to get rid of various magic numbers;
**  Added department email and type fields. Department Types with Lookup values support;
**  Reduced the overall Lines of Code (LoC) by approximately 18%;
*  Deprecation:
**  Replaced all instances of the "dPconfig" variable with the "w2Pconfig";
**  Adopted and converted the outgoing mails to PHPMailer lib;
**  Removed the old gateway.pl code for sending emails;
**  Removed unnecessary files and code where applicable;

== Open Issues ==

*  The cascading dependencies are still not 100%.  Although long chains (A->B-C->D->E) work fine and tasks with multiple dependencies work fine, there are a limited number of scenarios where dependencies do not behave as expected.
**  One such scenario is when you have a Dynamic Task A with children chain (B->C-D->E) and Task F which is dependent on Task A.  If B, C, D or E shift, they shift the rest of the chain as expected and the Dynamic Task (A) as expected but unfortunately F does not get updated.
