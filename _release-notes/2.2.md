== Open/Known Issues ==

*  As of 21 December, a small issue was found related to the Task Filters [http://forums.web2project.net/viewtopic.php?p=8419&highlight=#8419 http://forums.web2project.net/viewtopic.php?p=8419&highlight=#8419].
*  The cascading dependencies are still not 100% but very close.  Although long chains (A->B-C->D->E) work fine and tasks with multiple dependencies work fine, there are a limited number of scenarios where dependencies do not behave as expected.
**  One such scenario is when you have a Dynamic Task A with children chain (B->C-D->E) and Task F which is dependent on Task A.  If B, C, D or E shift, they shift the rest of the chain as expected and the Dynamic Task (A) as expected but unfortunately F does not get updated.
*  If you upgrade from dotProject, you may have an oddity with your default theme/display as the name has changed.  If this happens, edit your preferences, change to one of the existing themes, and save.
*  In Webkit browsers such as safari or chrome, in the Edit Task, Log Task, and a few other places, the clickable area of the tag is offset above the icon by half the icon height. Consequently, when clicking on an "edit task", about half the time, you would actually be clicking on the a tag for the next row's task; and thus go to THAT tasks's edit window. - This is already resolved for v2.3.
