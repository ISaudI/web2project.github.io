== Class Structure ==

As of v2.0, the class structure within the /classes folder has been refactored to support the Namespaces Standard from the PHP Standards Working Group:
http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards/web/php-coding-standard  Web2project will not formally make use of Namespaces in any of the v2.x releases but this will make it easier to support in the v3.x releases.
