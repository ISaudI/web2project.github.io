### Open/Known Issues

* The cascading dependencies are still not 100% but very close.  Although long chains (A->B-C->D->E) work fine and tasks with multiple dependencies work fine, there are a limited number of scenarios where dependencies do not behave as expected.
  * One such scenario is when you have a Dynamic Task A with children chain (B->C-D->E) and Task F which is dependent on Task A.  If B, C, D or E shift, they shift the rest of the chain as expected and the Dynamic Task (A) as expected but unfortunately F does not get updated.
* If you upgrade from dotProject, you may have an oddity with your default theme/display as the name has changed.  If this happens, edit your preferences, change to one of the existing themes, and save.
