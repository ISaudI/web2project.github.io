== About Departments ==

Departments are a component of companies and can be found under the “view company” page within the company module. Note that the module is disabled by default, and must first be enabled. To enable the departments module:

*Go to system admin
*Click 'View Modules'
*Change departments from 'disabled' to 'active' and 'hidden' to 'visible'.


You can assign multiple departments to a company, and multiple contacts to a department.  Using departments is another added benefit in helping you manage your contacts and projects.

When you click on the department tab in the view company page you will see a list of available departments. From this tab you can:

*Add a department
*Edit a department
*View how many users are assigned to each department.

== Add/Edit Departments ==

To add a new department to a company you must first be in the View Company Page and click on the department tab, then click the “New Department” button.

When adding a new department you must enter a department name. The rest of the fields are optional, but as a best practice its always a good idea to be as descriptive as possible.

From this page you can:

*Enter department name
*Phone number
*Fax
*Adress
*City
*State
*Zip
*Link to URL
*Assign this department as a child to another department
*Assign a user as the lead of that department
*Enter additional details
