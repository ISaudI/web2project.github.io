### Misc Changes/Improvements

*  Added more unit tests for dependencies, access control, retrieving dependent tasks, and task retrieval, not distributed with v1.3
*  Updated the system to eliminate more PHP 5.3 E_DEPRECATED warnings, the only ones left relate to PEAR Date
*  Added the Polish translation to core
*  Moved the mysql files around to prepare for additional multi-database support
*  Cleaned up some method signatures to eliminate some E_STRICT warnings
*  Updated permissions to allow a tasklog to be added even if the user can't edit the task directly
*  Deprecated the getDeny* functions, added functions with more logical names like canView and canDelete
*  Added deprecation warnings to a number of functions/methods that will disappear in v2.0
*  Cleaned up some default database values to be more consistent/logical
*  Added timezone/daylight savings selection to the user preferences - ''this information is not currently used by the system''

### Open/Known Issues

*  The cascading dependencies are still not 100% but very close.  Although long chains (A->B-C->D->E) work fine and tasks with multiple dependencies work fine, there are a limited number of scenarios where dependencies do not behave as expected.
**  One such scenario is when you have a Dynamic Task A with children chain (B->C-D->E) and Task F which is dependent on Task A.  If B, C, D or E shift, they shift the rest of the chain as expected and the Dynamic Task (A) as expected but unfortunately F does not get updated.
*  If you upgrade from dotProject, you may have an oddity with your default theme/display as the name has changed.  If this happens, edit your preferences, change to one of the existing themes, and save.
