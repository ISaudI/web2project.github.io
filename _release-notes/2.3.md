'''Release Date: 30 March 2011'''

This time around, we have a significantly larger changelog than normal. In addition to the core team - Keith, Pedro, Trevor, and Benjamin - a number of community members have distinguished themselves in their contributions on a variety of fronts:
*  '''CasN''' has done an outstanding job in the forums in reporting & debugging issues, helping other users on the forums, and some Add On module work.
*  '''Eureka''' has submitted great bug reports, the occasional core patch, an updated French translation, and shared quite a bit of work on a number of Add On Modules;
*  '''Opto''' has contributed detailed and useful bug reports, good patches, and insight on the forums;
*  '''RobertBasic''' appeared out of nowhere to contribute patches related to better UTF/Unicode handling, translations, character encoding in general, and even a complete rework of the PDF-generation;

If you use web2project and ever run into one of these guys, buy them a tasty beverage (coffee, soda, a beer) and say "thanks". They're part of what makes this a great community.

== Open/Known Issues ==

*  ''This issue has undergone serious work in the v2.3 release. While we don't consider it perfect, we believe it's nearly complete.'' The cascading dependencies are still not 100% but very close.  Although long chains (A->B-C->D->E) work fine and tasks with multiple dependencies work fine, there are a limited number of scenarios where dependencies do not behave as expected.
**  One such scenario is when you have a Dynamic Task A with children chain (B->C-D->E) and Task F which is dependent on Task A.  If B, C, D or E shift, they shift the rest of the chain as expected and the Dynamic Task (A) as expected but unfortunately F does not get updated.

*  If you upgrade from dotProject, you may have an oddity with your default theme/display as the name has changed.  If this happens, edit your preferences, change to one of the existing themes, and save.

== System Metrics ==

There are some core metrics that may be of interest to the geekier among us. By running the commands below, we get the metrics below (web2project is my base w2p directory):

''php phploc.php --count-tests --exclude=../web2project/lib ../web2project/''
