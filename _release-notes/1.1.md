*  [http://bugs.web2project.net/view.php?id=187 187] - Tasks - Update old tasks with Hours Worked Information

### Open/Known Issues

*  The cascading dependencies are still not 100%.  Although long chains (A->B-C->D->E) work fine and tasks with multiple dependencies work fine, there are a limited number of scenarios where dependencies do not behave as expected.
**  One such scenario is when you have a Dynamic Task A with children chain (B->C-D->E) and Task F which is dependent on Task A.  If B, C, D or E shift, they shift the rest of the chain as expected and the Dynamic Task (A) as expected but unfortunately F does not get updated.

*  At release time, the display of debugging information was left on.  Please see the Installation Notes above on how to turn them off.

*  At release time, the installation package - ''both the zip and tar.gz files'' - were created without web2project being in a subdirectory.  Therefore, when you uncompress it, all the files will go into the target directory directly as opposed to within a subdirectory.  This is already fixed for the v1.2 (December 2009) release.
