**Release Date:** 30 March 2011

This time around, we have a significantly larger changelog than normal. In addition to the core team - Keith, Pedro, Trevor, and Benjamin - a number of community members have distinguished themselves in their contributions on a variety of fronts:

* **CasN** has done an outstanding job in the forums in reporting & debugging issues, helping other users on the forums, and some Add On module work.
* **Eureka** has submitted great bug reports, the occasional core patch, an updated French translation, and shared quite a bit of work on a number of Add On Modules;
* **Opto** has contributed detailed and useful bug reports, good patches, and insight on the forums;
* **RobertBasic** appeared out of nowhere to contribute patches related to better UTF/Unicode handling, translations, character encoding in general, and even a complete rework of the PDF-generation;

If you use web2project and ever run into one of these guys, buy them a tasty beverage (coffee, soda, a beer) and say "thanks". They're part of what makes this a great community.

## Open/Known Issues

* ''This issue has undergone serious work in the v2.3 release. While we don't consider it perfect, we believe it's nearly complete.'' The cascading dependencies are still not 100% but very close.  Although long chains (A->B-C->D->E) work fine and tasks with multiple dependencies work fine, there are a limited number of scenarios where dependencies do not behave as expected.
  * One such scenario is when you have a Dynamic Task A with children chain (B->C-D->E) and Task F which is dependent on Task A.  If B, C, D or E shift, they shift the rest of the chain as expected and the Dynamic Task (A) as expected but unfortunately F does not get updated.

* If you upgrade from dotProject, you may have an oddity with your default theme/display as the name has changed.  If this happens, edit your preferences, change to one of the existing themes, and save.
