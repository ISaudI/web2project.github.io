**Release Date:** 17 August 2011

### New Features

* Added timezone configuration as an option at install time instead of as a post-install step;
* [Issue 78](http://bugs.web2project.net/view.php?id=78)  - Projects - Task dependencies not cascading
  * '''Previously an "Open/Known Issue":'''
    * <s>The cascading dependencies are still not 100% but very close.  Although long chains (A->B-C->D->E) work fine and tasks with multiple dependencies work fine, there are a limited number of scenarios where dependencies do not behave as expected.</s>
    * <s>One such scenario is when you have a Dynamic Task A with children chain (B->C-D->E) and Task F which is dependent on Task A.  If B, C, D or E shift, they shift the rest of the chain as expected and the Dynamic Task (A) as expected but unfortunately F does not get updated.</s>
* [Issue 515](http://bugs.web2project.net/view.php?id=515)  - Tasks - Detailed percent complete tracking
* [Issue 862](http://bugs.web2project.net/view.php?id=862)  - Tasks - Task duration and end date using server-side code
