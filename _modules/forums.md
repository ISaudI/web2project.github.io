## Module Overview

The Forum Module in web2Project is an optional added feature designed specifically to help improve communication and collaboration.

Forums are a great way to allow open discussions on just about anything. The web2Project forum module takes the methodology of standard forum usage to a whole new level because you can associate forums to specific projects.
