'''Release Date: 17 August 2011'''

This time around, we have a significantly longer release cycle than normal. Within the core team, there were new jobs, conferences, at least one alien abduction, lots of projects, and some travel. Regardless, this is a solid release that includes some major accomplishments.

== New Features ==

*  Added timezone configuration as an option at install time instead of as a post-install step;
*  [http://bugs.web2project.net/view.php?id=78 78] - Projects - Task dependencies not cascading
**  '''Previously an "Open/Known Issue":'''
***  <s>The cascading dependencies are still not 100% but very close.  Although long chains (A->B-C->D->E) work fine and tasks with multiple dependencies work fine, there are a limited number of scenarios where dependencies do not behave as expected.</s>
***  <s>One such scenario is when you have a Dynamic Task A with children chain (B->C-D->E) and Task F which is dependent on Task A.  If B, C, D or E shift, they shift the rest of the chain as expected and the Dynamic Task (A) as expected but unfortunately F does not get updated.</s>
