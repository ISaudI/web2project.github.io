title: Overall Code Metrics
---

One of the things this team has always prided itself on is the overall performance of the project and how we've improved metrics like code quality, duplication, test coverage, etc over time. To make sure out metrics are consistent and meaningful from release to release, we use Phing, the PHP Mess Detector, Copy Paste Detector, and other code QA tools. This guide shares how to set them up.

The overall process is:

1. Install Phing - [Instructions](https://www.phing.info/#install)
1. Install PHP Depend - [Instructions](https://pdepend.org/)
1. Install PHP CPD - [Instructions](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd)
