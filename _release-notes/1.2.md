=== v1.2 ===

*  Added description and url information to iCal entries to make them more useful

*  Standardized the method signatures for all core modules to simplify API development
*  Changed the Total Hours, Task Count, Percent Complete, and Worked Hours calculations to happen during selected updates and simply cache them for later requests

### Misc Changes/Improvements

*  Added more unit tests, not distributed with v1.2
*  Updated the system to suppress PHP 5.3 E_DEPRECATED warnings
*  Removed unnecessary code from the PHPMailer lib, the jscalendar lib, and ADODB lib
*  Added the Brazilian Portuguese translation to core
*  Converted the Projects, Companies, and Links modules to use the [[Search Hook|hook_search]] instead of the search object
*  Cleaned up some of the template generation to reduce duplication
*  Moved the mysql files around to prepare for additional multi-database support
*  Misc UI improvements including using the proper shortdate format, adding anchors to the sysval page
*  Reworked the Models and Controllers based on feedback from the CodeWorks Code Review to support a [http://blueparabola.com/blog/fat-models-are-good|"Fat Models" concept] which also moved most permissions validation from the Controllers to the Models - this is still underway, the Links module should be considered the reference implementation
*  Updated the report generation to use a randomly generated filename as opposed to an easily predictable one
*  [http://bugs.web2project.net/view.php?id=257 257] - Projects - Display of projects with sub-projects in cascade would make visibility much clearer (caseydk)
*  [http://bugs.web2project.net/view.php?id=321 321] - Files - web2project files uploading demands 777 permissions when it could do with less (caseydk)

### Open/Known Issues

*  The cascading dependencies are still not 100%.  Although long chains (A->B-C->D->E) work fine and tasks with multiple dependencies work fine, there are a limited number of scenarios where dependencies do not behave as expected.
**  One such scenario is when you have a Dynamic Task A with children chain (B->C-D->E) and Task F which is dependent on Task A.  If B, C, D or E shift, they shift the rest of the chain as expected and the Dynamic Task (A) as expected but unfortunately F does not get updated.
*  If you upgrade from dotProject, you may have an oddity with your default theme/display as the name has changed.  If this happens, edit your preferences, change to one of the existing themes, and save.
