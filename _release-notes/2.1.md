### New Features

* When editing a Task, you can designate it as able to accept Tasklogs for other users. Specifically, when someone with Edit Task permissions adds a Tasklog, they can log the time for anyone currently assigned to the Task.
* Beyond the normal development this time, we spent a great deal of time consulting legal professionals to research the possibility of converting from the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html GPL] to the [http://labs.metacarta.com/license-explanation.html#license Clear BSD] license. The good news is that it is possible, it's just quite difficult. Regardless, we are pursuing this for a later release.

### Open/Known Issues

* The cascading dependencies are still not 100% but very close.  Although long chains (A->B-C->D->E) work fine and tasks with multiple dependencies work fine, there are a limited number of scenarios where dependencies do not behave as expected.
  * One such scenario is when you have a Dynamic Task A with children chain (B->C-D->E) and Task F which is dependent on Task A.  If B, C, D or E shift, they shift the rest of the chain as expected and the Dynamic Task (A) as expected but unfortunately F does not get updated.
* If you upgrade from dotProject, you may have an oddity with your default theme/display as the name has changed.  If this happens, edit your preferences, change to one of the existing themes, and save.
