This guide was initially written in reference to Web2project v3.3.0 and has been updated to incorporate the features, fixes, and changes through the latest master development. While much of it will be applicable to the entire 3.x series, you may notice certain differences in functionality, user interface, and features. As we release new major versions of Web2project, we will work to update this manual in a timely manner.

From here, most people want the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation.html).

## Conventions used in this Guide

Web2project is an Open Source project. Therefore, development moves unevenly between holidays, personal commitments, new organizations adopting it, and everything else. As a result, there are always various versions of Web2project available for download in addition to the master/release branch. Sometimes these versions change behavior or system settings so to make these points clear, we've added this notation:

{% include icon-warn.html %} We use the Warning Icon to denote places where you can misconfigure or damage your data by accident. Before you make this change, read carefully and follow the directions precisely.

{% include icon-question.html %} We use the Question Icon to denote common or frequently asked questions. While we work to resolve and simplify these items, there are just some complicated concepts that we have to capture and apply.

{% include icon-discussion.html %} We use the Discussion Icon to designate features discussed or planned for future development but have little supporting functionality in the system. We include them here to provide context and explanation for the roadmap.

{% include icon-info.html %} We use the Info Icon to denote features available in development. The development version always has the latest and greatest features, fixes, and functionality but has not been tested as official releases have been. Unless you are a PHP developer or willing to live with instability, we do not recommend using this code in production systems. Consider it a preview of work to come.
